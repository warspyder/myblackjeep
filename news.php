            <h2>News</h2>
                <h3>October 22nd, 2009 - Added Two Photo Albums</h3>
                <p>Found four photos of the front bumper and winch plate. My son Brian modified the bumper and fabricated the winch plate for me.</p>
                <p>Made the website image, the ones in the upper left corner, into a photo album.</p>

                <h3>October 21st, 2009 - Interal Changes Only</h3>
                <p>Made changes to the file layout. No changes to the way the site looks.</p>

                <h3>August 29th, 2009 - Photo Gallery working!</h3>
                <p>I decided to write my own photo gallery system, it is very basic. I did use <a href="http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox2</a> a javascript to overlay images on the current page. It is very easy to setup and use.</p>

                <h3>August 26th, 2009 - WOW! How time flies!</h3>
                <p>We got back, the other day from a week long camping and offroading trip. I have some photos to post online.</p>
                <p>So for now I have a basic Photo Gallery setup. I decided to write my own even though there are a few very good Gallery programs availible for free and several websites that provide image hosting for free.</p>
                <p>I am going to add two blogs; <i>Trips Reports</i> and <i>Modifications</i>. For now they will be nothing more than static pages. I am going to write my own blogging program. More on that later.</p>

                <h3>March 9th, 2009 - Sooner Than I Expected.</h3>
                <p>I couldn&acute;t sleep. So I went ahead and coded up a routine to display a random image. When ever the page changes or gets refreshed a different image gets displayed.</p>
                <p>Yes, I know! There are a couple of images of vehicles that are not Jeeps. There is an image of our first 4 wheel drive, a 1979 Ford Bronco, at least it was black. There&acute;s an image of a 1992 Suzuki Sidekick, it to was black.</p>

                <h3>March 8th, 2009 - No visual changes.</h3>
                <p>Actually I made no changes to the website at all. I did however work on some photographs for the website.</p>
                <p>I plan on showing a random photo in on the page. Coming real soon!</p>

                <h3>March 1st, 2009 - Made a few little changes</h3>
                <p>I made a couple of very minor changes on the <a href="aboutmyjeep.php">About My Jeep</a> page.</p>
                <p>Added the <a href="aboutme.php">About Me</a> page and added a temporary <a href="contact.php">Contact</a> page.</p>

                <h3>February 27th, 2009 - Welcome To My Black Jeep Web Page</h3>
                <p>I have a few ideas for this site. Nothing grand, there are far to many great web sites with forums, how to's, and links. I certainly don't want to try to compete with them.</p>
                <p>Check back and see the changes. Both here and on my Jeep. I have a long to do list for both.</p>
