            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Mark Coulter. I grew up in Colorado and Montana. My wife grew up in Colorado and Florida. We now live in Utah. Out of all the places we have lived Utah is the closest to home. We have 5 children of our own and are foster parents for 4 of my sister-in-law's childern. All our children are adults living out on their own, except one. He recently has gotten out of the Navy and hasn't decided what he wants to do.
                </p>
                <p>For as long as I can remember, I wanted a Jeep. My first car was a 2 wheel drive pickup and I was always getting stuck somewhere. I then bought a VW bug and promptly made it into a Baja Bug. I went everywhere with it, even around a few stuck 4x4's. The price of a Jeep seemed to be always out of reach for us.
                </p>
                <p>We came across a great deal for a black 1979 Ford Bronco. It took us almost a year to finally go offroading somewhere that I had not been to with my Baja Bug. We spent a week in Moab prior to the Moab Easter Jeep Safari in 1984. That was when the EJS was only on the weekend. There were so many trails to choose from we decided to go early and drive the ones we didn't go on for the EJS. Dan Mick was our trail leader and he arrange for some Easter Eggs to be hidden for the kids, we had a blast. So did the kids.
                </p>
                <p>We have had a few different 4 wheel drive vehicles over the years. Some time in the early 2000's I finally got my Jeep and it has been a work in progress ever since.
